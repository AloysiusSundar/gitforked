Across The Spider-Verse is the sequel to a film that not only changed the landscape of the animation medium as a whole but one that also presented a heartfelt narrative about one's identity, choices and responsibility and just as when the rest of the industry was catching up to the standard that Into The Spider-Verse set, Across The Spider-Verse pushes the standard again. They set the bar. They raised it. All in the shape of a true to the soul Spidey shaped story that this time, asks the question of what it takes to be Spider-Man and what makes Spider-Man, Spider-Man? 

\
This is not a review of the film but rather my vaguely gathered thoughts on certain themes that the films takes on and the notions that it challenges and how it confronts one of the uglier sides of the fandom. 

## Gwen Stacy, holy shit, she's so cool.

The films opens with Gwen Stacy, a teenager bitten by a radioactive spider and who, since then has been the one and only crime fighting fugitive, the friendly neighbourhood Spider-Woman. Of her world at the very least.  
\
When you're making a film that deals with the multiverse and a film this huge a scale, it is very easy for it to lose itself in it's own grandiose but Across The Spider-Verse manages to avoid all that and ultimately remain a personal story about Miles, his struggles and his growth but it's also very much a Gwen Stacy film at the same time as much as it Mile's. 
\
\
Gwen's universe breathes an ethereal essence that acts as a mood ring of sort, reacting and changing according to her emotions in perfect synchrony  (which is come on, what a cool fucking idea) and just like that, her universe stops being just a backdrop and becomes almost a character of it's own, transcending from being just a location to a tool, a kaleidoscope which helps audience understand the wave of feelings that engulfs Gwen's very being. The guilt, the grief, the love, the pain. These emotions cascade, and the universe becomes a canvas of her experience.

She starts her story without a band, still struggling with the loss of her friend Peter Parker and the with the lingering ache of loosing the only friendship she had managed to make since Parker. While Gwen is still evidently struggling with the loss of Peter Parker, she does not blame herself for Peter's death unlike in other stories where Peter Parker, the Spidey of his worlds more often than not, blames himself for the death of Gwen Stacy of his worlds.
\
\
Her character arc at it's core is a exploration of the intricate dance between rejection and acceptance. With a vulnerable courage, she comes out to her father hoping he would be understanding of her and her identity but is instead met with repudiation. An emotional blow that pierces the depths of her being. Her father would rather stick to his morals than embrace and accept his daughter for who she is. 
\
\
Although there is no confirmation of any sort from the makers of the film themselves,  leaving room for interpretation and speculation and with a lot of talk surrounding her identity, regardless of what you want to believe in, it is irrefutable that she is a transcoded character (her room literally transforms into a trans flag when she's talking about her secret identity for fuck's sake) and her story, even if it is not an explicitly stated allegory for the trans experience, it's still a story that I think trans and most queer people can still find some comfort in. Her arc offers solace and a sense of belonging. It speaks to the universal human desire for acceptance and the resilience required to forge an identity in a world that often actively resists understanding. In the unspoken depths of her journey, those who identify as trans and queer can still find a mirror to their own struggles, a source of comfort and inspiration, even within the uncharted territories of subtext and allegory.
\
\
She starts the film feeling out of place, rejected by her dad but eventually starts her own band, finds acceptance, not only from others like her but from her own dad too. Her character arc is crucial to the film because as the film reaches it's climactic turning point, we find ourselves suspended in a state of uncertainty and anticipation. The unresolved cliff-hanger looms large, leaving us on the edge and yet, the atmosphere is filled with a profound sense of cinematic completion. In a poignant scene that emerges towards the very ending, Gwen Stacy and her father embrace each other with emotions and colors flooding the screen. A real tear jerker. This moment, imbued with a tender resolve, serves as an emotional climax, a cathartic release within the narrative's own self-contained universe amidst the multiversal chaos.

## Miguel O'Hara, The Spider-Verse, The Spider-Society and The Canon.

Miguel O' Hara, former head of the genetics program of Alchemax in the distant future, after getting tricked into drinking a powerful hallucinogenic drug,  becomes the one and only crime fighting vigilante, Spider-Man. Of his world. Of his time at the very least.
\
\
Walking into the film, one of my concerns was with the mischaracterization of Miguel O' Hara, the first anti-authoritarian
Spider-Man in the comics now being the figure head of a seemingly authoritarian society, The Spider-Society and in ways, while it can be seen as a mischaracterization, it does not assassinate his character like I feared it would. I was afraid he'd be reduced to a scary, powerful badass who's all head and no heart, I was afraid his character would be devolved to a just formidable force that is devoid of humanity for our protagonists to overcome but that was far from what the truth was and I was very glad to be proven wrong.
\
\
You can tell that Miguel still cares for Miles, A thread of connection binds them through their shared experience, an unspoken understanding of the journey they both tread, that every Spider-Man treads and in Miguel's mind, a journey that every Spider-Man MUST tread. You can see and understand why he is pressed about Miles, about the anomalies that ripple through the multiverse because he has walked the path of one and faced it's consequences first hand. Scars etched upon his soul. Amidst all the chaos, Miguel stands as a flawed yet resolute figure, driven by a desire to do what others won't. His story to me is not one of an authority enforcing absolute rule, but that of an ordinary soul grappling with the extraordinary circumstances he's thrusted upon to, trying to do the right thing. That's a trait that is integral to the character of Miguel and Spider-Man in general. (He also most definitely listens to Carti so bonus points, I mean, he's literally a vamp)

Miguel's story speaks to the complexities of the flawed nature of humanity, a reminder that  even beneath the veneer of power and strength lies a beating heart and how in our pursuit of righteousness, we can lose sense of who we are and in Miguel's case, losing touch with the essence of what it truly means to be Spider-Man.
\
\
The weight of "the canon", the sacred construct, the established narrative, events oven in fate looms heavily upon Miguel and the Society. I find it perfectly understandable why Miguel and the larger Spider-Society as a whole would feel the need to preserve the canon, After all, it is these canon events that every Spidey go through ultimately makes them, forges them into the hero that their neighbourhood needs them to be. They know that ultimately every Spidey overcome their tragedies and arise a new person with having learnt new lessons. So it is these tragedies that ultimately make Spider-Man, as Spider-Man. Right? No. 

## No Says Our Brooklyn Hero.

Miles Morales, a teenager after being bitten by a radioactive spider and after the death of Peter Parker, Miles becomes the one and only friendly neighbourhood crime fighting vigilante, Spider-Man. Of his world. At the very least.
\
\
You see Miles going through the typical Spidey problems we've grown to associate with the character and his legacy throughout the years so much so that the Marvel Editorial refuses to move on from them and let the character evolv- okay, we're getting sidetracked. You see Miles struggling in a relentless tussle that every other Spidey is cursed to forever be entangled in, to find the right balance between being Spider-Man, being a student and being a son and the responsibility that comes along with all the three three roles and more.
\
\
On the surface, it may see as though Miles is just treading familiar ground, retracing the character arc he went through in the first film. The question of whether he can truly embody the role of Spider-Man or not, the first film largely dealt with Miles overcoming the shadow of doubt, but at it's core, Miles' journey in this film transcends the realm of doubt and ventures into the realm of affirmation. It is less about him believing he can be Spider-Man and more about him proving that he IS Spider-Man. However, at the same time, the essence of his struggle does not lie in him proving himself, It's merely a by product of his inherent heroism and compassion unwavering in the face of adversity in his journey to defy destiny.

The tragedies may shape, mold, and propel them forward, but at the character's core, it is not the tragedies that define Spider-Man, it is the defiance of them. Peter Parker continues to swing through the streets of New York a single issue after Gwen Stacy's death because hey, the city needs a friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man. The foundation of the character does not lie within the struggles and the tragedies but within the indomitable willpower that refuses to surrender to those tragedies, that refuses to let those tragedies repeat, that refuses to standby idle when the tragedies happen when it can be helped, it lies within the depths of compassion and within the unwavering commitment to protect the innocent, and no Spider-Man encompasses this idea than Miles Morales does in this film.
\
\
In Spider-Man: Edge Of Time, a rather often overlooked game and the younger brother of the more successful Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions, Peter tells Miguel O' Hara (almost poetic) that Miguel does not get the first thing about being Spider-Man if Miguel can just stand by and allow someone to suffer or die because he does nothing. Ultimately. that's simply who Spider-Man is. Just a guy who wants to save all he possibly can. He is not someone who'd partake in the trolley problem, he's someone who'd find a way to outsmart it. 

## Anomaly? Maybe. Spider-Man? Definitely.

In one of the many breath-taking visual sequences of the film, there exists a moment of tension when Miles Morales is chased by Miguel O' Hara. The chase is not merely a heart-pounding spectacle but it also carries significance beyond the boundaries of the of the film. Miguel O' Hara continuously emphasizes throughout the film that Miles can never be one of them.
\
\
Within this powerful subtext lies an unflinching examination and a commentary on a surprisingly large corner of the fandom who seem to refuse to accept the fact that Miles Morales is Spider-Man for some unexplainable and some unfathomable reason (It's.. racism. No matter what the caveat is, it's always just racism).
\
\
Across the Spider-Verse boldly confronts this issue, holding up a mirror to the fandom and society as a whole. It sheds light on the irrational resistance towards accepting Miles Morales as Spider-Man. The film becomes a powerful force for change just like how the first comic and the first film challenged the status quo, demanding a shift in perspective and a re-evaluation of the narrative landscape.

Beyond that however, even within the walls of the film, this iteration of Miles still continues to be the ultimate example that captures the essence and the of idea of Spider-Man. Spider-Man is not supposed to be a hero who was called by destiny, he's not the chosen one that the legends foretold, he's simply a kid who happened to be at the right place, right time. Or rather, the wrong place, the wrong time and now goes out there to do his best everyday to make a change despite the odds. That's Miles Morales. That's Spider-Man.
